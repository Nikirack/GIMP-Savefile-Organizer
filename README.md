# GIMP Savefile Organizer üíæ

**GIMP Savefile Organizer** is a tool designed to help you organize your GIMP savefiles, which can often become scattered or difficult to manage. Since GIMP doesn't have a built-in savefile organizer, this tool was created to fill that gap and make your file management smoother.
